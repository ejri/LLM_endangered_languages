# The Endangered Languages Initiative 

The endangered languages intitiative is a project aimed to use foundational and large language models to safeguarding and revitalization of endangered languages (and cultural heritage).

The project aims to curate data from endangered languages, and create fine-tuned models for the languages, and create a simple tutor bot application to teach people the languages.   

We'll start with pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure.

Languages (fine-tuned models):
- [ ] Kaska



APIs:
- [x] Cohere API integration
- [x] OpenAI API integration
- [ ] Conversational (whisper)
